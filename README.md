### Project 1 - Open World Platformer Game made using HTML Canvas

_[Link to Game](https://bamoradia.github.io/Project_1/)_**

* Plafform game that the user interacts with using the arrow keys
* Goal is to get as many points as possible and get a high score
* Collect Items and jump on Enemies to get even more points
* Avoid hitting the enemies from the side or else the Game is Over
* The environment is randomly generated to keep the user guessing



This was my first project at GA. It was made while learning Canvas and after learning the basics of Javascript.
My goal was to experiment with what I could make with the skills we had just learned and to learn a new skill at the same time. I learned Canvas specifically for this project, and I wanted to learn more about game mechanics and simulating physics using code.


### Project 2 - Calendar App used to organize your Life
_[Eaze Calendar](https://eaze-calendar.herokuapp.com/user)_**

* We understand that people have different priorities
	* So we allow the user to make different calendars i.e. Work, Personal, etc.
* Add events to certain Calendars to keep your events easily organized
* Add Tasks which are independent to quickly remember things that need to be completed
* Full Stack MEN App
* User Authentication done using BCrypt and Sessions
* Database stores user information and all Calendars, Events, and Tasks
* Calendar displays the current month and allows the User to make new Events associated with a specific Calendar


This was a paired-programming project at GA. Alex Delgado and I wanted to build something that could be used in the future and something that would also push us beyond what we had just been explicitly taught. We picked a Calendar App because its a universal tool that everyone uses and needs but also has a lot of complexity to it. We have 4 data models, which are interconnected which made us plan well in advance of how we would need the models to interact. It also made us interact with the native Data function in Javascript and understand all its intricies so we could render the calendar correctly based on the month and year. We both are naturally more backend inclined, and this forced us to work on the front-end design, and specifcally the user interaction. We wanted the User to intuitively be able to use the calendar without any issues. User engagement is crucial in the success of the a product, so we kept it in the forefront during the design and build of the App.
